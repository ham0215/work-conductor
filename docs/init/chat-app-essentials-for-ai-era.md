- Currently, most of the work time is spent staying connected to chat tools like Slack
- We want to maximize the time spent connected to this product instead
- Tweet/post work updates, notify others as needed
  - Even if the notification target is not explicitly specified, AI interprets the content and sends notifications
  - Messages are grouped by content. Can also be specified explicitly
- Seamlessly chat with AI in the same way as tweeting
- Manually checking channels is outdated
- A window for working with AI and a window for subscribed content
  - Multiple windows stacked like cards
